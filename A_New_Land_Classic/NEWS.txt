Version 0.14.4:
 * WesCamp can now try to translate this add-on.  Older versions had
   at least one flaw preventing translation.
 * Some messages now appear only to allies.  Enemy teams can no longer
   see messages about completing research, donating gold, or sharing
   knowledge.  This only works for network games, when enemy players
   use different computers (not a hot-seat game).
 * In the standard era, Loyalists can now use "Diplomacy" to negotiate
   for Dwarves.  This matches the mainline map, "4p - A New Land",
   where Loyalists can already get Dwarves.  The expanded era remains
   as before: only Outlaws can get Dwarves.
 * In "Diplomacy", when donating gold or sharing knowledge:
    * Each menu item now displays the amounts, as in "Gold: 4 => 24"
      or "Progress: 1/3 => 2/3", so players can check these amounts.
      For example, a player might donate gold to its poorest ally, or
      share knowledge where an ally has made the most progress.
    * Each announcement to allies now displays these same amounts, so
      the receiving player understands what is happening.
    * All factions can now use these options.  So, Outlaws and Orcs
      can now donate gold, and Undead can now share knowledge.
    * A player can no longer share knowledge where an ally already has
      full progress, like 3/3 in agriculture.
    * A player can no longer share knowledge of warfare with an ally
      who already knows everything about warfare.  This fixes the
      equivalent of mainline bug #14822 <https://gna.org/bugs/?14822>.
    * When player has less than 20 gold, or less than enough
      knowledge, then these options turn red and disable themselves.
      (When player has no allies, these options still disappear.)
 * If a player learns warfare but forgets to "Choose New Recruit",
   then a reminder now appears every turn.
 * A player who knows everything about warfare can no longer continue
   to research warfare.  The researchers silently switch to studying
   agriculture; and in "Oversee Research", the option for warfare
   turns red and disables itself.
 * A player, who makes fast progress, can now complete research more
   than once per turn.
 * The enemy leaders in The Great Wall and The Last Stand now have
   "garrison" as a visible trait, to inform players that these units
   never move off their castle.
 * Aybabtu Valley:
    * Thieves lost "dagger" and keep "pick pocket" as their only melee
      weapon.  The weapon now displays "steals 4 gold" as a weapon
      special.  Each hit now makes 1 damage.
 * The Great Wall:
    * A unit that finds a flaming sword can now choose whether to take
      or leave the sword.
    * Guards in caves now have the loyal trait and one random trait.
    * Team flags now have the same wind direction as village flags.
    * Host can now change income of human sides.
 * The Last Stand:
    * AI can now destroy more types of buildings. Encampments and Orcish
      Castles, and villages that replace forests, are no longer immune
      to destruction.
    * Destruction of an enemy mine now lowers income by 10, not by 8.
      The message already said, "10 less income," so this fixes a bug.
    * Spiders now have the loyal trait.
    * Each enemy side has less income. This compenstates for not paying
      upkeep to loyal units.
    * Host can now change income of human sides.

Version 0.14.3:
 * Mushroom Farms now provide the correct amount of gold. Version 0.14.2
   introduced a bug that confused Mixed Flowers (^Efm) with Mushroom
   Farms (^Emf). Re^Efm is an empty farm, but Re^Emf is a crop. Because
   of this bug, Goblin Spearmen and Walking Corpses behaved as if Re^Emf
   was both an empty farm and a crop; so they earned gold every turn.
   They now earn gold every 2 turns, as they did with version 0.14.1.

Version 0.14.2:
 * README.rst now mentions Wesnoth 1.10.
 * For each option in "Get to Work!", if the cost is too high, then the
   option now becomes red. All red options are too expensive.
 * When workers destroy villages in swamp or water, or destroy bridges
   over swamp or water, the base terrain no longer changes. For example,
   Muddy Quagmire no longer becomes regular Swamp.
 * Workers can no longer destroy bridges over deep water.
 * Changes to castles:
    * Walking Corpses now longer build Dwarven Castle. They now build
      Human Castle, same as Peasants build.
    * All workers can now build castles on snow. Peasants and Walking
      Corpses build Snowy Human Castle. Ruffians build Snowy Encampment.
      Goblin Spearmen build Snowy Orcish Castle.
    * Workers can no longer build keeps on sunken ruins or swamp ruins.
 * Aybabtu Valley:
    * Each keep is now adjacent to both castle hexes.
    * Fog is now off.
    * There are some tweaks to the story.
    * The scenario objectives now mention Thieves.
 * Dome Isle:
    * The scenario objectives now show the add-on version.
 * The Last Stand:
    * Level 2 guards now have the loyal trait. Enemy sides no longer pay
      upkeep for those units!
    * Guards with 0 moves now have 'still' as a visible trait.

Version 0.14.1:
 * Nagas no longer refer to themselves as merfolk.
 * The option to build an Orcish Keep now has an image for Orcish Keep,
   not Underground Keep.

Version 0.14.0:
 * Kernigh became maintainer and converted this add-on from Wesnoth 1.8
   to 1.9. This add-on now requires Wesnoth 1.9.
 * The directory's name changes from A_New_Land to A_New_Land_Classic,
   to match the add-on's name.
 * Two new files, README.rst and NEWS.txt, describe this add-on.
 * Right-click help is no longer missing. During you turn, you can
   right-click your leader for help.
 * Changes to eras:
    * A new era, A New Land: Standard, contains only Loyalist units, but
      allows all players to join the game, including those players who
      lack the era. This era might have existed before, but it went lost
      and was not part of 0.13.
    * A New Land: Expanded removes all units from Extended Era, and
      replaces them with equivalent units from mainline campaigns. This
      change affects lines for Naga Guardian, Orcish Shaman and Rogue
      Mage.
    * Outlaw faction can no longer choose Outlaw Princess as leader.
    * There are no longer any unused units or second copies of units.
    * All unit ids now contain 'ANLC' and all image paths now contain
      '-anlc', to prevent conflicts with other multiplayer add-ons.
 * Changes to movement:
    * Units with 0 moves can now use "Get to Work!" and "Diplomacy".
      This feature comes from mainline "4p - A New Land".
    * "Choose New Recruit" and "Oversee Research" (for scholars on
      universities) are now free actions, not costing any moves.
 * Changes to new recruits:
    * Players can no longer waste diplomacy or research by choosing a
      unit that they already know how to recruit. Also, "Diplomacy" and
      "Oversee Research" now show the lists of available units.
    * Undead researching warfare can now get Blood Bat (level 1) instead
      of Vampire Bat (level 0).
    * Undead doing "Diplomacy" can no longer summon Tentacle of the Deep.
      This monster would get stuck on the castle.
 * Changes to terrain:
    * Orcs now build Orcish Castle and Orcish Keep.
    * Mushroom crops no longer use the Mushroom Grove terrain. They now
      use the new Mushroom Farm terrain from Wesnoth 1.9.
    * Workers of all factions can now chop down Mushroom Grove.
    * Workers can now use more flavors of terrain. They can now build on
      more flavors of grassland, hills and mountains. They can chop down
      more flavors of forest, including those forests that grow on hills
      or any other base terrain.
    * Workers can now build villages and universities on snow.
 * Several messages no longer have display problems, such as extraneous
   underscores or obsolete markup.
 * New maps:
    * Aybabtu Valley returns! This map, by Nyogtha, is new to A New Land
      Classic, but comes from A New Land: Maps, an old add-on for
      Wesnoth 1.2. Ogres are now absent, but Thieves return: a Thief can
      steal gold from other players.
    * Dome Island is a new 2-player map by xudojnik.
 * The Great Wall:
    * Team flags are now long flags and now have animation.
    * Chests are no longer broken, but now give gold.
 * The Last Stand:
    * Map settings now disable fog.
    * Units trapped in spider webs are now loyal.
    * Skirmishers who rescue the trapped units now lose their moves.

Version 0.13:
 * ReNoM converted this add-on from Wesnoth 1.4 to 1.8.
 * A New Land Classic 0.13 is the last version from the 1.8 add-on
   server <http://add-ons.wesnoth.org/1.8/>.

Versions for Wesnoth 1.6:
 * There is no add-on for Wesnoth 1.6.
 * The mainline developers included "4p - A New Land" in Wesnoth 1.5 and
   1.6. This map adapts A New Land: The Last Stand, and uses the Default
   era with special map settings. This mainline map survives into
   Wesnoth 1.8 and 1.10.

Versions for Wesnoth 1.4:
 * Bob_The_Mighty converted A New Land to Wesnoth 1.3 and 1.4. These
   versions introduce right-click menu items like "Get to Work!", and the
   A New Land: Expanded era. There are only two maps: The Great Wall and
   The Last Stand.

Versions for Wesnoth 1.2:
 * Bob_The_Mighty created this add-on for Wesnoth 1.2, with help from
   governor and Rhuvaen. These first versions included three maps:
   End Of Days, The Great Wall and The Last Stand.
 * A New Land 0.9.0c is the last version from the 1.2 add-on server
   <http://add-ons.wesnoth.org/1.2/>.
 * Kernigh made a fork with different bugs. The last version of this
   fork is 0.9.0c patch k7 <http://r.wesnoth.org/p241694>.
