==================
A New Land Classic
==================

A New Land Classic is a set of multiplayer maps for Wesnoth 1.10. It has
more maps and more factions than the mainline map, "4p - A New Land".
Here, crops grow thrice in one day, mines offer gold, and universities
teach victory. Players build more villages and castles.

To play, use either of two eras.

* **A New Land: Standard** only has Loyalists, but anyone can join the
  game. Peasants can build. Mages can study at universities.
* **A New Land: Expanded** features Loyalists, Outlaws, Orcs and Undead.
  Only players who install the era can join the game.

Install
-------
To install this add-on, put A_New_Land_Classic directory inside your
add-ons directory.


Strategy
--------
During your turn, right-click your leader for help.

At the beginning, you can only recruit workers and scholars. To build
something, move your worker to some hex and right-click your worker.

An 'elven' village is a university. You will need one. Some maps start
with one; else you must find or build a village on grassland, then
upgrade it to a university. Then move your leader or a scholar there,
and right-click it. If your leader does diplomacy, or your scholar
researches warfare, then you can recruit new types of units.

During the battle, you must balance the need to recruit more units
against the need to increase your income with farms, mines or villages.
